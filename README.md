[ Web LuXe: High-Dimensional Robust Inference ]

---

**Web LuXe** is a high-dimensional probabilistic inference engine designed to analyze and monitor web application responses in a scientific, multi-dimensional way.  
It builds a robust statistical baseline using advanced features like entropy, DOM structure, network metrics, and more.  
It detects anomalies with **high confidence**, supporting adaptive, high-dimensional analysis across diverse environments.

---

- Multi-dimensional feature extraction (30+ dimensions possible)  
- Robust probabilistic inference using **MinCovDet** (Fast-MCD)  
- Chi-square thresholding for anomaly detection  
- Noise reduction through DOM analysis and logical block evaluation  
- Multi-system support: **Windows, Linux, Termux, iSH**  
- Adaptive calibration with outlier rejection  
- Highly extendable for future development (payload engines, extraction modules, fingerprinting)
