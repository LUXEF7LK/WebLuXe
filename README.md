[ Web LuXe: High-Dimensional Robust Inference ]

---

## Overview

**Web LuXe** is a high-dimensional probabilistic inference engine for analyzing web application responses with robust statistical models.  
It builds a multi-dimensional baseline using features like entropy, DOM structure, network metrics, and more.  
Anomalies are detected with high confidence using robust covariance and Chi-square statistics.

---

## Features

- Multi-dimensional feature extraction (30+ dimensions possible)
- Robust probabilistic inference using **MinCovDet**
- Chi-square thresholding for anomaly detection
- Noise reduction via DOM analysis and logical block evaluation
- Adaptive calibration with outlier rejection
- Multi-system support: **Windows, Linux, Termux, iSH**
- Highly extendable for future development (payload engines, extraction modules, fingerprinting)
